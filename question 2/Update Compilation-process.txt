Sequence of Commands to compile the program
  1. Save the program to a file with extension .c
  2. Compile the program:
    - Type gcc add.c -o add
      a. gcc is a command used to start the compilation of a program
      b. program.c is the source code which will be compiled
      c. -o program specifies the name of the output file/executable
      d. The compiler will translate source code into machine code and link all libraries â€“ in this case: stdio.h - and produce an executable file.
  3. Run the program, by typing ./add

Compilation process Explanation:
  1. Preprocessing: The compiler searches for any libraries that are mentioned and include the contents of them.
  2. Compilation: The preprocessed source code is translated into assembly language
  3. Assembly: The assembly language is converted to machine code
  4. Linking: The machine code is linked to the libraries to output an executable file
